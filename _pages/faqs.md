### Is this an arranged marriage?
depends on who you ask. Rinki insists that its arranged and Vritant is in denial.

### Is he robbing the cradle (or) is she robbing the grave?
as a man of science, I (Vritant) would like to prove otherwise.
 Per the **half your age plus seven rule**, at the time of our wedding,
 ( 29 / 2 ) + 7 < 23.
<br>Hence proved. not that I am trying to justify myself or anything :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

### Is Rinki her real name or her nick name?
yes it is her real name, not to be confused with 'Pinky'

### Who are those kids in the home page? are they really you two?
Yes. Our fathers went to the same school and are friends, Thats how we know each other.
This picture is (probably) from our trip to Ooty long ago.
